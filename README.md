Oceans Drift is a first-person survival experience, that takes the player on an epic immersive journey after the destruction of his submarine by a USSR missile attack. Lost at sea with scanty resources he must survive and return back home to his family.

PLOT
In 1980 Charlie Parker a U.S. Navy war-hero was on-board a U.S. Submarine carrying out it's operations in the Arctic Circle. 
The submarine was detected as hostile by the USSR and was therefore attacked with 4 torpedo's.
The American's were caught unaware of the attack which led to the destruction of the Submarine. Some of the crew men had tried to escape in their escape pod's but never made it safely to the shore. The cold freezing Arctic water killed the entire submarine crew by hyperthermia.
Charlie Parker's pod had some how got damaged by an ice berg and surfaced up on the ocean the rough waves and bad weather threw the pod on a very small deserted island with no food or resources.
Charlie wake's up to find himself stranded on the island, with just a small box of supplies that contain 3 cans of beans and 2 packets of bacon and a bar of chocolate. 
As the day passed by Charlie started exploring the island but had found nothing useful on it as it was very small. As the night passed the weather worsened, It became cold, Charlie managed to sleep under a tree and spend the night. His body temperature kept falling low and the last resources of meat and chocolate saved him from dying.
He started crafting a raft and went on to explore the vast ocean. Living on a raft on an entire vast-open ocean was not easy. Bad weather, heavy rains and rough tide's accompanied him.
The raft was often threatened by sharks and whales, and after the deplenishment of all his resources Charlie has to catch fish and eat them raw. As day's passed lost at sea, Charlie came across various small islands in the Atlantic where he find's new resources and survival equipment, some of these islands were dangerous being habitated by cannibal eating people. Some other islands were strange and of the haunted types.
After spending 90 days lost at sea, with no rescue team on it's way, Charlie had given up, that's when his raft came over the mysterious "Bermuda Triangle". As soon as he was over it, his compass stops working and the tide becomes so calm, the skies become dark with a bright God ray passing through the clouds. Charlie dive's into the ocean, he explores the depths and finds the ruins of so many ships and planes. He gets back to the raft and the waves get rough, he rows through the raging tides and after crossing the triangle alive the tide gets calm again. After spending another 3 more days at sea, he sees a coast gaurd boat and calls for help. He was then rescued and taken to the Florida coastline where he once again re-unites with his family.
